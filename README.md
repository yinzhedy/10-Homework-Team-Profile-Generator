## Description:
    This is a Node.js command-line application that prompts the user for information regarding their team members and generates a styled html file displaying the given information for each member. The user is prompted for the email, employee ID, name, and role of each member of the team. There are three categories of team members: managers, interns, and engineers. When adding a manager the user is prompted for an office number, for interns they are prompted for their school, and for engineers the user is asked for a GitHub username; within the generated Html file GitHub usernames are displayed as clickable links to the corresponding GitHub profile page. Whenever the user has finished adding a team member they are prompted with the option to either add another member or say no, after choosing no the user is asked once again if they are finished adding members (ensuring a single faulty entry doesn't accidentally close out the application.) The user is then prompted to enter a name for their generated file. 

    My motivation for this project was to supply the user with a simple and easy way of generating a webpage to display their team roster. I have future plans to improve the application, implementing additional features and pursuing a more polished and aestehtically pleasing presentation for the generated roster webpage.
